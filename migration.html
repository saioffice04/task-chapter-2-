    <p class="a">This book provides information for migration to the NetView V6R3 program. Before beginning your installation, read the NetView program directory.</p>
    <b class="a">Other sources of information</b>
        <ul class="a">
           	 <li> For detailed information about the steps required to install the NetView program, refer to <i>IBM Z NetView Installation: Getting Started.</i></li>
            	 <li>If you are installing the NetView program on the same LPAR as an existing NetView program, see "Running Multiple NetView Programs in the Same LPAR" in<i> IBM Z NetView Installation:<b> Configuring</b> Additional Components</i> while completing the steps in this book.</li>

        <b class="h1">Overview</b>
        <div class="d2"></div>
        <p class="a">Migration consists of:</p>
        <ol class="a" type="1">
            <li>	Installing the NetView program from distribution media using SMP/E with the help of the NetView program directory</li>
            <li>	Making necessary additional preparations to your z/OS system for the current NetView release</li>
            <li>	Modifying your existing NetView installation to incorporate changes that were made to the current NetView release</li>
            <li>	Verifying the migration by testing the basic functions of the NetView program</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="a">This book is designed to guide you through the migration and verification of the NetView program in a minimum amount of time.</p>
        <b class="h1">Hardware and Software Requirements</b>
        <div class="d2"></div>
        <p class="a">Refer to the NetView program directory for detailed information and an inclusive list of the hardware and software requirements for installation.</p>
        <b class="h1">Installation Package</b>
        <div class="d2"></div>
        <p class="a">For detailed information about the installation package contents, refer to the NetView program directory.<br><br>
             Workstation-based NetView code is provided in 2 formats:</p>
             <ul class="a">
                <li>	DVD</li>
                <li>	Electronic internet delivered .pax package</li>
             </ul>
             <p class="a">The Z NetView Enterprise Management Agent (NetView agent) is packaged as a separate FMID that is SMP/E installable. For more information about installing the NetView agent, see the Program Directory (GI11-9446).</p>
             <p class="a">The GDPS Continuous Availability solution functions were available as a component starting with the NetView for z/OS V6R1 product. The NetView V6R2 product required the NetView Monitoring for GDPS V6R2 product to authorize using the GDPS Continuous Availability solution functions. Starting with NetView for z/OS V6R2M1, the GDPS Continuous Availability solution functions moved from the NetView V6R2 product to the NetView Monitoring for GDPS V6R2M1 product, which is renamed to IBM Z NetView for Continuous Availability from V6R3.</p>
             <b class="h1">Installing the New NetView Release While Running an Earlier NetView</b><br><b class="h1"> Release</b>
             <div class="d2"></div>
             <p class="a">If you want to keep running your installed version of the NetView program as your production system while you plan for and migrate to V6R3, the following actions can facilitate your migration:</p>
             <ul class="a">
                <li>If you ordered this package as a Custom-Built Product Delivery Offering (CBPDO, 5751-CS3), you must install the NetView program V6R3 files into separate SMP global and target zones from those used for your existing NetView release.</li>
                <li>	Unless you plan to run two full NetView programs concurrently, it is a good idea to delete the old NetView release when your migration is completed.</li>
                <li>	The modules that are copied into SCNMLPA1 during NetView program V6R3 installation are backward- compatible with the following versions of the NetView product:<br><br>
                    –	Tivoli NetView for z/OS Version 6 Release 2 (requires PTF UA97461)<br>
                    –	Tivoli NetView for z/OS Version 6 Release 1 (requires PTF UA70457 and UA97460)<br><br>
                    The modules in the SCNMLPA1 data set are backward-compatible with previous NetView releases. Therefore, it is recommended to run with the copy of these modules from the current release to keep the SCNMLPA1 data set up-to-date. Delete the old copy of the SCNMLPA1 data set and place the NetView program V6R3 copy of the SCNMLPA1 data set in the LPALST member. The change to the LPALST member takes effect the next time your z/OS system is restarted.<br><br>
                    Note, PTFs UA97461 and UA97460 change the format of Canzlog such that it can be configured to be dynamic in size. All future updates to Canzlog require these compatibility PTFs be applied.
                    </li>
                <li>	The ISTIECCE load module in NETVIEW.V6R3M0.SCNMLNK1 is not compatible with the ISTIECCE module from NetView V1R4. Be sure that the correct level of this module is included in the VTAMLIB DD statement in your VTAM start procedure. Using an earlier version of the ISTIECCE module or not having this module in the correct library can result in status monitor initialization failure or other unpredictable results.</li>
                <li>	Decide how you are going to access the LNKLST modules for the previous (existing) NetView release while migrating to the NetView program V6R3 program. You can use the STEPLIB data set concatenation to access the NetView LNKLST libraries for both releases while you are migrating to the new release, or you can use a PROGxx PARMLIB member to access the NetView program V6R3 libraries while using the STEPLIB data set concatenation for the libraries for the NetView program from which you are migrating.</li>
             </ul>
                <p class="a">Support is provided for running two releases of the NetView program, NetView management console, and RODM on one production system. For more information about running two NetView releases on the same system, see "Running Multiple NetView Programs in the Same LPAR" in <i>IBM Z NetView Installation:<b> Configuring</b> Additional Components.</i></p>
               <b class="h1">Migration Process</b>
               <div class="d2"></div>
               <p class="a">Follow the steps in the process outlined in subsequent sections to migrate to the current release of the NetView program. These steps are a high-level overview of the installation process used for new users, and serve as a checklist to ensure that the environment is prepared and that the NetView program is installed properly. The environments that are prepared for the current NetView release include:</p>
               <ul class="a">
                <li>	MVS system</li>
                <li>	UNIX System Services</li>
               </ul>
               <p class="a">After preparing these environments for the NetView program, the migration steps are grouped in the following way:</p>
               <ul class="a">
                <li>	Base NetView functions</li>
                <li>Graphical NetView functions</li>
                <li>	Advanced NetView configuration</li>
               </ul>
               <p class="a">Before you begin the migration process, make a backup copy of your NetView libraries.</p>
               <b class="h1">

Use the Data REXX function to include REXX instructions and functions in data files.

                                    <li>Update the CNMSJH12 sample job to refer to the data sets that contain data model definitions for the features that you are using. Then restart the RODM address space with the cold start option and run the CNMSJH12 sample job to load the data model into RODM.</li>
                                    <li>	Update the RODM start procedure to refer to the data sets that contain data model definitions for the features that you are using. Then restart the RODM address space with the cold start option and specify the INIT method (for example, EKGLISLM) to load the data model into RODM during initialization.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>	Optional: After loading the current data model into RODM, checkpoint the RODM data model so that the current NetView data model is used when the RODM address space is started with the warm start option. You can create the RODM checkpoint using the following command:</li>
                              <div class="d3" >mvs f ekgxrodm,chkpt</div>

                               <p> Agent names preceded by an asterisk (*) are disabled. Copy the TOWER.MSM statement to the CNMSTUSR or CxxSTGEN member and remove or add asterisks as necessary to enable the agent that you plan to use. Optionally, you can use MODIFY.TOWER statements to enable the MSM tower and agent subtowers. When the TOWER.MSM statement is enabled, the %INCLUDE statement for FLCSOPF (used for operator profiles) is also enabled.</p>
                                <li>	Upgrade your MultiSystem Manager agent to the current level.</li>
                                <li>	Review your MultiSystem Manager initialization file (provided as FLCSAINP before NetView V5R1).</li>
                                <li>Allocate additional NetView DSRBs if necessary.</li>
